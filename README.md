# Car-Price-Predictor

ðŸš— Car Price Predictor is a machine learning-powered web application designed to predict the resale value of cars based on various features such as age, mileage, fuel type, and more. Built with Python, Flask, and Scikit-learn, this project demonstrates how data science can be used to make informed pricing decisions.
### Overview
This project predicts the selling price of a car based on user input. It uses a Linear Regression model trained on a dataset containing various features like car brand, model, year, and fuel type. The application is deployed as a simple Flask-based web interface where users can input car details and get predictions instantly.
